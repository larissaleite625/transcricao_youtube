 Huh, what a green, careful one
 Seriously?? Oooooh! We hurt ourselves for fun Forst feet up the air until our hearts go numb Addicted to a lonely kind of love What I wanna know is how we got this stress Now we're paranoid Everything is going dark Nothing makes me sadder than my head I'm running out of tear drops Let it hurt till it stops I can't keep my grip I'm slipping away from me Oh God, everything is so false But I can't feel the same The emptiness is heavier than you think I'm tripping on the edge High as a kite I'm never coming down And if you hear me catch you know how it feels To be alone is how we get this stress Now we're paranoid Everything is going dark Nothing makes me sadder than my head I'm running out of tear drops Let it hurt till it stops I can't keep my grip I'm slipping away from me Oh God, everything is so false But I can't feel the same The emptiness is heavier than you think To be beside a violent tragic state of mind Lost my halo Now I'm my own antichrist To be beside a violent tragic state of mind Lost my halo Now I'm my own antichrist I'm running out of tear drops Let it hurt till it stops I can't keep my grip I'm slipping away from me Oh God, everything is so false But I can't feel the same The emptiness is heavier than you think I'm running out of tear drops Let it hurt till it stops I can't keep my grip I'm slipping away from me Oh God, everything is so false But I can't feel the same The emptiness is heavier than you think To be beside a violent tragic state of mind Lost my halo Now I'm my own antichrist The emptiness is heavier than you think
