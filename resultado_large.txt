 Teardrops We hurt ourselves for fun Forced feet of fear until our hearts go numb Addicted to a lonely kind of love What I wanna know Is how we got this stressed out Paranoid, everything is going dark Nothing makes me sick Nothing makes me sick Nothing makes me sadder than my head I'm running out of teardrops Let it hurt till it stops I can't keep my grip I'm flipping away from me Oh God Everything is so false But I can't feel a thing The emptiness is heavier than you think I'm tripping on the edge Higher Cause I look high I'm never coming down And if you hear me Guess you know how it feels To be alone So how we get this stressed out Paranoid, everything is going dark Nothing makes me sadder than my head I'm running out of teardrops Let it hurt till it stops I can't keep my grip I'm sinking into your arms I'm sinking into your arms Flipping away from me Oh God Everything is so false But I can't feel a thing The ending, this is heavier than you think Suicidal, violent, tragic state of mind Lost my halo, now I'm my own antichrist Suicidal, violent, tragic state of mind Lost my halo, now I'm my own antichrist I'm running out of teardrops Let it hurt till it stops I can't keep my grip on Slipping away from me Oh God Everything is so false But I can't feel a thing The emptiness is heavier than you think I'm running out of teardrops Let it hurt till it stops I can't keep my grip on Slipping away from me Oh God Everything is so false But I can't feel a thing The emptiness is heavier than you think Teardrops Teardrops Teardrops Teardrops Teardrops Teardrops The emptiness is heavier than you think The emptiness is heavier than you think
