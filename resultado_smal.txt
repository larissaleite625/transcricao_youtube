 Poor man wouldn't talk that up, but he still pare the bubble That's Voice is достиbng the as sh devices OK, that's fine but it's only new We hurt ourselves for fun Force the feet of fear until our hearts go numb Addicted to the lonely kind of love What I wanna know is how we got this stress Now we're paranoid, everything is going dark Nothing makes me sadder than my head I'm running out of tear drops, let it hurt till it stops I can't keep my grip, I'm slipping away from me Oh God, everything is so false, but I can't feel the same The emptiness is heavier than you think I'm tripping on the edge High as a kite, I'm never coming down And if you hear me, guess you know how it feels To be alone How we get this stress down, paranoid Everything is going dark, nothing makes me sadder than my head I'm running out of tear drops, let it hurt till it stops I can't keep my grip, I'm slipping away from me Oh God, everything is so false, but I can't feel the same The emptiness is heavier than you think Seeking the sight of violent tragic state of mind Lost my halo, now I'm my own antichrist Suicidal violent tragic state of mind Lost my halo, now I'm my own antichrist The melody drops, let it hurt till it stops I can't keep my grip, I'm slipping away from me Oh God, everything is so false, but I can't feel the same The emptiness is heavier than you think I'm running out of tear drops, let it hurt till it stops I can't keep my grip, I'm slipping away from me Oh God, everything is so false, but I can't feel the same The emptiness is heavier than you think Tear drops, tear drops, tear drops I'm running out of tear drops The emptiness is heavier than you think
